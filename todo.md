# Todo List

## For Sarpong

- [ ] Check the password success page. Don't know what the script file at the buttom that I have commented is for.
      I copied and made changes to the error pages so I don't know the use for that one. Check and delete if necessary.
- [ ] Fix forgot password feature
- [ ] Set up notifications
- [ ] Refactor code:
  - [ ] Remove unused code
  - [ ] Add comments
- [ ] Add tests
- [ ] Remove debug mode and toolbar
- [ ] Setup docker environment
  - [ ] Set up Redis
  - [ ] Set up Postgres
- [ ] Add documentation in README.md
- [ ] Add a license

## For Nathan

- [ ] Add chatbot feature (with Sarpong)

## For Albert

- [ ] Add profile pic on dashboard as option for user to edit profile
- [x] Error page no longer shows red x image (Check by visiting a wrong url -> http://127.0.0.1:8000/chatrooms/chatroom/100/)

<!-- Put an x in the square brackets when done -->
